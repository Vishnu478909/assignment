    <h2 class="MI">About Bumarah</h2>
    <pn class="MI">
        In an Indian team desperately searching for a death overs' bowler, Jasprit Bumrah came to the fore through the Indian Premier League, as a boon for cricket in the country.<br>
         The scantily-built pacer from Gujarat has managed to perfect the art of bowling inch-perfect yorkers as an understudy to Lasith Malinga as a part of the Mumbai Indians franchise and <br> has grown into an indispensable asset for the Indian team in the limited-overs format.
         Having been a consistent performer in the domestic circuit, Bumrah has been a menace to the batsmen at the Ranji level since his debut.
         His quick-arm action has made his variations almost indiscernible - starting from his slower deliveries to his reverse-swinging yorkers at the death. An injury kept him out of action for a while in the 2014/15 seasons but he returned and continued to perform unaffected by the injury break.A national call-up seemed to be just around the corner.<br>
         The inevitable call came at last as Bumrah travelled with the Indian team to Australia as an injury-replacement for Mohammad Shami, eventually making his debut in the dead rubber at the Sydney Cricket Ground. He has delivered consistent performances in coloured clothing and has since become an irreplaceable asset for his captain, consistently holding his nerve and becoming MS Dhoni's bowling counterpart as a last-over specialist for India. He went on to perform commendably for a young fast bowler in India's next world events - the ICC Champions' Trophy in 2017, where he only took 4 wickets in 5 matches, but conceded at an economy rate of just 5 runs an over, particularly impressive for a death overs' specialist.
         Only one question remained. Can Bumrah become an effective Test bowler? He has shown appetite and ability for red-ball cricket, bowling Gujarat to their maiden Ranji Trophy title, in 2016-17. However, the Kookaburra ball posed a whole new challenge. He was handed the elusive Test cap in January 2018 in South Africa, and showed his adaptability with his skiddy nippers and unpredictable scrambled-seamers, proving to be the find of the tour for India - in other words, a good start in Tests for the versatile Bumrah.

            I want to keep on adding new skills to my armoury<br>
As a bowler, you have to constantly have to learn new things, and that's been my main aim all the time<br>
You never know: anything can happen on any day<br>
My focus is to always enjoy and bowl good lines and lengths<br>
Lasith Malinga has been a great influence for me to bowl yorkers consistently.<br>
Self-belief, I think, is my biggest strength. The mental toughness comes into play whenever the chips are down.<br>
In white-ball cricket, things are different - over there, you outsmart the batsman, and over here in Test cricket, it's all about patience and consistency.<br>
used to play tennis ball cricket quite a lot before playing serious cricket. Over there, you bowl yorkers. That could be the reason I bowl yorkers.<br>
I want to keep on adding new skills to my armoury.
